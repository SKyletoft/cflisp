# CFLISP

An experimental C compiler for Digiflisp written in Rust.

Parses and compiles a subset of C to flisp assembly. All supported types are one byte large. Non native operators are supported via function calls. The example below is what you should expect when compiling with optimisations. `float`s and `double`s are not supported at all, nor is the preprocessor.
`struct`s are supported, but cannot be nested or returned from functions.

Basic maths, function calls (even recursive function calls), if-else-statements (even if-else-if-else-statements), for and while (not do-while) loops, arbitrary levels of pointers, comments, hex and decimal printing are all supported and tested features. On Linux you can even call qaflisp to assemble it directly (untested on Windows/Mac)

```c
//  tests/test1.c

int main() {
    int *ptr = 0;
    int x    = 5;
    if (x == 5) {
        x = 3;
    }
    *ptr = x;
}
```

into this:

```flisp
; tests/expected1.sflisp
        ORG     $20
main    LDA     #$00
        PSHA            ; ptr
        LDA     #$05
        PSHA            ; x
        CMPA    #$05
        BNE     if_end_main_2
if_then_main_2
        LDA     #$03
        STA     $00,SP  ; x
if_end_main_2
        LDX     $01,SP  ; ptr
        LDA     $00,SP  ; x
        STA     $00,X
        LEASP   $02,SP  ; Clearing variables
        RTS

__init_ LDA     #0
        LDX     #0
        LDY     #0
        LDSP    #$FB
        JSR     main
__end__ JMP     __end__


        ORG     $FF
        FCB     __init_
```

## Compiler flags
Flag | Name | Description
--|--|--
x | hex | Prints numbers as hex instead
c | comments | Disables comments (variable names mostly)
p|tree|Prints the parsed tree structure of the program
P|tree_structless|Prints the parsed tree structure after structs have been simplified down to native types
t|type_check| Disables type checking
s|print_result|Prints the compiled code to stdout instead of a file
a|assemble|Calls qaflisp directly. Requires qaflisp to be on $PATH. Probably doesn't work on Windows
o|out|Sets the name of the output file (following argument)
g|debug|Adds debug info. Disables removal of unused names and adds `ORG $20` to the top for easier digiflisp debugging
O|optimise| Enables optimisations. In practice it mostly just fixes bad code generation rather than actually optimising the code. (Capital o, not zero)

## Todo
(additional features still under consideration)
* Line numbers for parse errors
* Interrupts
* Inline assembly
* `-a` flag on Windows and Mac
* Figure out licensing
* Implement own flisp simulator (16 bit addressing?)
* Web interface like godbolt
* Fix the type checker
* New ABI. (Multibyte size variables, return structs from functions)
* Actual optimisations
* casts
