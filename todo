Optimisation: copy out a single calculation of address when array is used a lot

Assign struct to any non named pointer

Optimise statement: Remove add/sub/mul 0 and mul/div 1

Investigate tree eval. If only the latest stored value is read, swap LDA 0,SP and STA 0,SP with PULA and PSHA.
	This saves memory storing the instructions and saves performance since you don't need leading and following LEASPs
