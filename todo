split Num into Signed and Unsigned
labels/gotos

Cast to bool: Bit-and with itself and then TRF C -> A
maybe?

Optimisation: copy out a single calculation of address when array is used a lot
Optimisation: Calculate offset directly for constant indexes
Optimisation: flip lhs and rhs in add in pointer read/write so that if either, lhs is the constant
