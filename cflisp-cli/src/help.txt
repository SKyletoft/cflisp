Options:

--help  Print this page

-x      Prints numbers as hex instead
-c      Disables comments (variable names mostly)
-p      Prints the parsed tree structure of the program
-P      Prints the parsed tree after structs have been simplified down to native types and after -O2 IR optimisations have been performed
-t      Disables type checking
-s      Prints the compiled code to stdout instead of a file
-a      Calls qaflisp directly. Requires qaflisp to be on $PATH. Probably doesn't work on Windows
-o      Sets the name of the output file (following argument)
-g      Adds debug info. Disables removal of unused names and adds `ORG $20` to the top for easier digiflisp debugging
-O      (/O1/O2) Enables optimisations. (If a level is specified it needs to be its own flag)
-k      Disables interrupts after main has exited
